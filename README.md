# ðŸŽ¯ Cursor Experiment Evaluator

**Ultra-simple experiment quality evaluation using Cursor AI**

Your team writes experiments in Loop â†’ Copy to Cursor â†’ Get instant quality feedback â†’ Improve back in Loop

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Write** your experiment in Loop (or anywhere)
2. **Open** this project in Cursor (`.cursorrules` auto-loads)
3. **Ask** Cursor to evaluate your experiment
4. **Get** detailed feedback and scoring
5. **Improve** until you hit 32+/40 points (80% quality)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Simple Evaluation

Just ask Cursor any of these questions with your experiment text:

### **Quick Evaluation**

```
Evaluate this experiment against the project quality standards:

[PASTE YOUR EXPERIMENT HERE]
```

### **Section-by-Section**

```
Evaluate this root cause statement:
[PASTE ROOT CAUSE HERE]
```

```
Evaluate this hypothesis:
[PASTE HYPOTHESIS HERE]
```

### **Complete Analysis**

```
Score this experiment out of 40 points and suggest improvements:

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Standards

**Target Score:** 32+/40 points (80% quality)

### **Root Cause (10 pts)**

- Format: "[problem] because [reason]"
- Focus: User problems only (not business/solutions)
- Length: 1-2 sentences max

### **Supporting Data (10 pts)**

- Include specific sources
- Use bullet points
- Support the root cause directly

### **Hypothesis (10 pts)**

- Present-tense belief statement
- Include clear rationale
- Must be testable/falsifiable

### **Prediction (10 pts)**

- "If...then..." format
- Measurable outcomes
- No implementation details

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

### **Individual Process:**

1. Write experiment in Loop
2. Open this project in Cursor
3. Ask Cursor to evaluate your experiment
4. Improve based on feedback
5. Repeat until 32+/40 points

### **Team Process:**

1. **Quality Gate**: 32+/40 before team review
2. **Business Review**: Focus on strategy (quality automated)
3. **Launch**: High-confidence experiments

## ðŸŽ“ Quick Training (5 minutes)

1. **Read** the quality standards above
2. **Try** one evaluation prompt with an existing experiment
3. **Practice** improving based on feedback
4. **Establish** 32+/40 quality gate for your team

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Q: Cursor gives generic responses?**
A: Make sure `.cursorrules` file is in your project. Restart Cursor if needed.

**Q: Scores seem inconsistent?**
A: Make sure you're in this project folder when asking Cursor to evaluate.

**Q: What if I get 40+/40?**
A: Great! Your experiment is ready. Focus on business review.

**Q: Cursor won't evaluate?**
A: Check that you pasted both the prompt AND your experiment text.
